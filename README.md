# Stop Watch

This is a basic stop watch that I developed using JavaScript and one external library for the icons. To enhance my knowledge of classes in JavaScript, I divided the project into three parts: index.html, index.js, style.css, and timer.js.  

## Goal

My aim was to create a timer that had a graphical representation of the remaining time, so I utilized a circle SVG as the base and added various attributes, such as fill, stroke, stroke-width, r, cx, cy, and transforms for customization. The challenging aspect of the project was determining the amount of perimeter remaining to avoid exceeding the visual clock. To calculate this, I used 2 * pi * 90 / 2 = 282 and multiplied it by two for the entire circumference.
